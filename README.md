How to use this program:

To encrypt: python vigenere.py (code word) (path to file) E
To decrypt: python vigenere.py (code word) (path to file) D

The only differance is that D if for decrypting and E for encrypting

Note: if it encounters a space of spceal charecter it will not change it but it will still count it in the keyword.
